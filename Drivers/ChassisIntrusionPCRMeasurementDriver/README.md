This is a DXE driver that measures the chassis intrusion state of the Framework Laptop into PCR[6]ยน.

Just over a year ago, while reverse-engineering the embedded controller firmware (before it was open-source), I stumbled
upon a [host command that reports the entire chassis intrusion state] and speculated that it could be used as part of a
PCR measurement. Framework let me know that it _wasn't_ being used like that.

The value reported by this embedded controller feature:

- changes every time the chassis is opened
   - ... even if the machine was powered fully off when it was opened
- resets when the RTC battery is removed

Because it increments unless reset and otherwise simply tracks the raw count of times the chassis was opened, it's
somewhat tamper-evident.

<summary>Notes from use</summary>

As part of developing this driver, I've captured PCR measurements from four boots:

1. Before installing the driver (baseline)
2. After installing the driver
3. After opening the chassis once
4. After removing the driver

The differences are below:

### 1 to 2

We observe a difference in PCR 2 due to the loading of a new driver.

I cannot explain the difference in PCR 10, though I presume it is likely from `systemd-boot` (my bootloader).

PCR 6 shows a change after chassis intrusion.

### 1 vs 4 (does removing the driver revert the PCRs?)

```shell-session
dustin@rigel:/mnt/c/Users/Dustin$ diff -u pcrs.0.before  pcrs.3.after_removal
dustin@rigel:/mnt/c/Users/Dustin$
```

Yes.

ยน I chose PCR[6] because it is the closest PCR in the specification to being OEM-controlled, and if this were to become an official extension then that might be the right place for it. I do not know what else is measured into PCR[6].
